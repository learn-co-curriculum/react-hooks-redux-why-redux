# Why Redux?

## Learning Goals

- Explain how **Redux** encourages a single source of truth
- Explain how actions fit into the Redux flow

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn about the Redux architecture for building web
applications.

## Benefits of Moving to Redux

As our **React** applications become larger, our state becomes more spread out
between different components. At a certain point, the component tree becomes a
web of props and state that can obscure our view of how components are handling
and sharing data with each other.

There are ways to get around this, like storing all of our state in one high
level container component, but this can ultimately _increase_ the complexity of
your props.

**Redux** offers a different solution. It encourages storing all of the
necessary data in our application in a JavaScript object _separate_ from our
components. Picture having all your application state in one big object, like
this:

```javascript
state = {
  user: {
    name: "bob",
    hometown: "philly",
  },
  interests: [
    {
      name: "pokemon",
      type: "game",
    },
    {
      name: "game of thrones",
      type: "tv show",
    },
  ],
};
```

Similar to component state, all our data can be held in an object. The
difference here is that, since Redux state is separate from the component tree,
we can grab _any_ part of this data for _any_ component that needs it, just by
connecting the component! Using Redux means we have a **single source of truth**
for our application's state.

## Accessing Our State

To make this state available for components to connect to, we provide access by
wrapping the component tree, similar to `Router`. This gives us access to Redux
functions that allow us to grab state and map it to the props being given to a
component. Components can then read these props like normal, as though they were
receiving them from a parent component.

Consequently, complex interaction between components is made easier. Take for
example sibling components (rendered side by side in a parent) and cousin
components (the children of sibling components). Without Redux, if siblings are
both displaying or manipulating the same bit of shared data, that data needs to
be stored in their parent component's state. If _cousins_ are sharing data, the
data needs to be stored in the _grandparent_ component, the closest shared
'ancestor' component.

In Redux all these interactions are structured the same way. Every component we
allow can get and update state data regardless of the position of components in
a tree.

## Updating Our State

So we hold all of our data in one place and with some configuration, we can read
it as props in regular React components. When we want to update that data, we
must send an action, which is a set of strict instructions _we create_ that
tells **Redux** how to update it.

```javascript
action = {
  type: "ADD_INTEREST",
  payload: {
    name: "hockey",
    type: "sport",
  },
};
```

Here, we can imagine that after a user fills out a form and clicks submit, we
will create an action that tells **Redux** how to incorporate the update into
the state. Any time we update the state in **Redux**, we must create an action
first. This action is just a plain old JavaScript object.

These actions are also made available to components. Any component we connect
will be able to modify the state using an action we've defined.

Following a specific design pattern that we'll explore through the upcoming
lessons, we can use these actions to maintain and update our Redux state. These
state changes trigger React's component lifecycle which re-renders the page to
display the updated state. In this way, the cycle of data is completed.

## Summing Up

**Redux** places all of our data in one place â€” the state. This state is just a
plain JavaScript object. In fact, all the pieces of Redux are plain old
JavaScript. It is the pattern, the way the information flows, that makes Redux
awesome.

To change our application state, we need to create an action that defines how to
update that state. The action, combined with the previous state, produces an
updated state.
